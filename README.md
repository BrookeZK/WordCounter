# _Word Counter_

#### _A Program that counts how many times a word appears in your sentence, 04.26.2019_

#### By _Brooke Kullberg_

## Description
_This program gathers user input - a word and a sentence - and then it counts how many times that word appears in the sentence. To do this, the program asks for a word, stores it in its working memory, then asks for a sentence and does the same. Both are turned to lower case, so that the program can process the user input. Then the program checks the sentence for the word, and tells the user how many times it has appeared._

## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|

| Program takes in a sentence and returns the sentence to the user | "this is a word" | "this is a word" |
| Program takes the word input and checks that it appears in the sentence input one time | "word" & "this is a word" | 1 |
| Program takes the word input and checks that it appears in the sentence more than once | "the" & "the dog and the cat" | 2 |
